#+TITLE: CRUD Application in Haskell

* What is it?
This web-application is written in Haskell and uses the Yesod web framework, it's similar to https://alternativeto.net where users can put software and their alternatives and uses SQLite as it's database and Meilisearch as the search engine.
* Setup guide
To self-host this web-application, download Haskell and Stack, I recommend GHCup.
** MeiliSearch
Download MeiliSearch from their website and get the keys and put them in ~env.dhall~ in ~config~,  with the name ~meilisearchKey~.
** Google Secrets
In the application there is Auth specifically Google Auth so get Google secrets from their webapp and name them in ~env.dhall~ as ~googleId~ and ~googleSecret~ respectively.
Contact me if you can't get it working following these steps.
